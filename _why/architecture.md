FICAM is the federal governmentâ€™s enterprise approach to design, plan, and execute common ICAM processes.

The FICAM architecture is a framework that an agency can use for ICAM program and solution roadmap planning. The FICAM architecture focuses on enterprise identity processes, practices, policies, and information security disciplines. A federal enterprise identity is the unique representation of an employee, a contractor, an enterprise user, such as a mission or business partner, a device, or a technology that a federal agency manages to achieve its mission and business objectives ([OMB Memorandum 19-17](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/M-19-17.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}).
