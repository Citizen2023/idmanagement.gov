ICAM is the set of tools, policies, and systems that an agency uses to enable the right individual to access the right resource, at the right time, for the right reason in support of federal business objectives.

Agencies implement ICAM services and solutions to unify their IT services, strengthen physical access control, and improve information security. Understanding the ICAM building blocks is key to understanding the FICAM architecture.

ICAM consists of three practice areas and two supporting elements. The supporting elements enhance practice area capabilities.
