Experts created the FICAM architecture in 2009 to provide federal agencies a common ICAM segment architecture. This FICAM architecture, enhanced with complementary implementation sections, became the primary foundation for the *FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Plan*.

In 2015, federal ICAM experts collaborated on an updated FICAM architecture. The update, which was intended to be more concise, easy to understand, and visually appealing, incorporated the latest updates in cybersecurity, enterprise architecture, and ICAM policy and technology.

This site contains the current 2023 update of the FICAM architecture, complemented by playbooks developed by ICAM committees across government, supersedes the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.
