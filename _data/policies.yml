- name: "M-19-03: Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Agencies by enhancing the High Value Asset (HVA) Program"
  summary: "With the creation of the HVA initiative in 2015, the federal government's CFO Act agencies took a pivotal step toward the identification of its most critical assets. DHS, in coordination with OMB, established a capability to assess agency HVAs, resulting in the identification of critical areas of weakness and plans to remediate those areas of weakness. It established three possible categories for designating federal information or a federal information system as an HVA: Informational Value, Mission Essential, or Federal Civilian Enterprise Essential (FCEE). It also updates the required approach for agencies to report, assess, and remediate HVAs to protect against cyberattacks."
