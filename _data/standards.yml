- name: "NIST SP 800-205: Attribute Considerations for Access Control Systems"
  summary: This guideline provides federal agencies with information for implementing attributes in access control systems. Attributes enable a logical access control methodology where authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some cases, environment conditions against policy, rules, or relationships that describe the allowable operations for a given set of attributes. This document outlines factors which influence attributes that an authoritative body must address when standardizing an attribute system and proposes some notional implementation suggestions for consideration.

- name: "NIST SP 800-63-3: Digital Identity Guidelines"
  summary: Agencies use these guidelines as part of the risk assessment and implementation of their digital service(s). These guidelines provide mitigations for an authentication error's negative impacts by separating the individual elements of identity assurance into its component parts.

- name: "NIST SP 800-63A: Digital Identity Guidelines - Enrollment and Identity Proofing"
  summary: This guideline focuses on the enrollment and verification of an identity for use in digital services. Central to this is a process known as identity proofing in which an applicant provides evidence to a credential service provider (CSP) reliably identifying themselves, thereby allowing the CSP to assert that identification at an Identity Assurance Level (IAL). This document defines technical requirements for each of the three IALs.

- name: "NIST SP 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines - Authentication and Lifecycle Management"
  summary: These guidelines focus on the authentication of subjects interacting with government systems over open networks, establishing that a given claimant is a subscriber who has been previously authenticated. The result of the authentication process may be used locally by the system performing the authentication or may be asserted elsewhere in a federated identity system. This document defines technical requirements for each of the three Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs).

- name: "NIST SP 800-63C: Digital Identity Guidelines - Federation and Assertions"
  summary: These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. This guideline focuses on the use of federated identity and the use of assertions to implement identity federations. Federation allows a given CSP to provide authentication and (optionally) subscriber attributes to a number of separately-administered relying parties. Similarly, relying parties may use more than one CSP.

  summary: The guideline specifies the assessment for the reliability of issuers of PIV credentials and Derived PIV credentials. The reliability of an issuer is of utmost importance when a federal agency is required to trust the identity credentials of individuals that were created and issued by another federal agency.

  summary: This guideline contains technical specifications for biometric data mandated in FIPS. These specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and performance of the PIV credential. This specification addresses image acquisition to support the background check, fingerprint template creation, retention, and authentication. The biometric data specification in this document is the mandatory format for biometric data carried in the PIV Data Model (SP 800-73-1, Appendix A). Biometric data used only outside the PIV Data Model is not within the scope of this standard.
