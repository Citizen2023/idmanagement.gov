> This memorandum sets forth the federal government’s ICAM policy. To ensure secure and efficient operations, agencies of the federal government must be able to identify, credential, monitor, and manage subjects that access federal resources. This includes information, information systems, facilities, and secured areas across their respective enterprises. In particular, how agencies conduct identity proofing, establish enterprise digital identities, and adopt sound processes for authentication and access control significantly affects the security and delivery of their services as well as individuals’ privacy.

> With the creation of the HVA initiative in 2015, the federal government’s CFO Act agencies took a pivotal step toward the identification of its most critical assets. DHS, in coordination with OMB, established a capability to assess agency HVAs, resulting in the identification of critical areas of weakness and plans to remediate those areas of weakness. It established three possible categories for designating federal information or a federal information system as an HVA: Informational Value, Mission Essential, or Federal Civilian Enterprise Essential (FCEE). It also updates the required approach for agencies to report, assess, and remediate HVAs to protect against cyberattacks.

> Information and IT resources are critical to the U.S. social, political, and economic well-being. They enable the federal government to provide quality services to citizens, generate and disseminate knowledge, and facilitate greater productivity and advancement as a nation. It is important for the federal government to maximize the quality and security of federal information systems and to develop and implement uniform and consistent information resources management policies in order to inform the public and improve the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of agency programs. Additionally, as technology evolves, it is important that agencies manage information systems in a way that addresses and mitigates security and privacy risks associated with new IT resources and new information processing capabilities.

This integrated governance structure will improve mission delivery, reduce costs, and focus corrective actions toward key risks.
